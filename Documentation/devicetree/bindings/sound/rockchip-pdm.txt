* Rockchip PDM controller

Required SoC Specific Properties:

- compatible : "rockchip,pdm"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
  clock-names property.
- clocks-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
  property. Must contain "pdm_clk" and "pdm_hclk".
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
- dmas: list of DMA controller phandle and DMA request line ordered pairs.
- dma-names: identifier string for each DMA request line in the dmas property.
  These strings correspond 1:1 with the ordered pairs in dmas.
- pinctrl-names: must contain a "default" entry.
- pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.
- pinctrl-1: pin control group to be used for gpio.

Example:

pdm: pdm@ff040000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,pdm";
	reg = <0x0 0xff040000 0x0 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&clk_pdm>, <&clk_gates28 0>;
	clock-names = "pdm_clk", "pdm_hclk";
	dmas = <&pdma 16>;
	#dma-cells = <1>;
	dma-names = "rx";
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pdmm0_clk
		     &pdmm0_fsync
		     &pdmm0_sdi0
		     &pdmm0_sdi1
		     &pdmm0_sdi2
		     &pdmm0_sdi3>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&pdmm0_sleep>;
};
