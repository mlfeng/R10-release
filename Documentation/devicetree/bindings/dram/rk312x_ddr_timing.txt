* rk312x dram default timing is at arch/arm/boot/dts/rk312x-ddr-default-timing.dtsi

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "rockchip,ddr-timing"

- ddr3_speed_bin : Value is defined at include/dt-bindings/clock/ddr.h.
  It select ddr3 cl-trp-trcd type, default value "DDR3_DEFAULT".it must selected
  according to "Speed Bin" in ddr3 datasheet, DO NOT use smaller "Speed Bin" than
  ddr3 exactly is.

- pd_idle : Config the PD_IDLE value, defined the power-down idle period, memories
  are places into power-down mode if bus is idle for PD_IDLE DFI clocks.

- sr_idle : Configure the SR_IDLE value, defined the selfrefresh idle period,
  memories are places into self-refresh mode if bus is idle for SR_IDLE*32 DFI
  clocks (DFI clocks freq is half of dram's clocks), defaule value is "1".

- auto_pd_dis_freq : It's defined the auto power-down frequency in MHz (Mega Hz),
  when ddr freq greater than this setting value, auto power-down will disable.

- auto_sr_dis_freq : It's defined the auto selfrefresh frequency in MHz (Mega Hz),
  when ddr freq greater than this setting value, auto selfrefresh will disable.

- ddr3_dll_disb_freq : It's defined the ddr3 dll bypass frequency in MHz (Mega Hz),
  when ddr freq less than this setting value, ddr3 dll will bypssed.
  note: if dll was bypassed, the odt also stop working.

- lpddr2_dll_disb_freq : It's defined the lpddr2 dll bypass frequency in MHz (Mega Hz),
  when ddr freq less than this setting value, lpddr2 dll will bypssed.

- phy_dll_disb_freq : Defined the PHY dll bypass frequency in MHz (Mega Hz),
  when ddr freq less than this setting value, phy dll will bypssed.
  note: phy dll and phy odt are independent.

- ddr3_odt_disb_freq : Defined the ddr3 odt disable frequency in
  MHz (Mega Hz), when ddr frequency less then this setting value, the ddr3
  ODT are disabled.

- phy_ddr3_odt_disb_freq : Defined the phy odt disable frequency in
  MHz (Mega Hz), when ddr frequency less then this setting value, the phy
  ODT are disabled.

- ddr3_drv : Define the DDR3 driver strength in ohm.

- ddr3_odt : Define the DDR3 ODT in ohm.

- phy_ddr3_clk_drv : Define the phy clocks driver strength in ohm.
  when connect DDR3.

- phy_ddr3_cmd_drv : Define the phy commands driver strength in ohm.
  when connect DDR3.

- phy_ddr3_cmd_drv : Define the phy dqs and dq driver strength in ohm.
  when connect DDR3.

- phy_ddr3_odt : Define the phy odt in ohm when connect DDR3.

- lpddr2_drv : Define the LPDDR2 driver strength in ohm.

- phy_lpddr2_clk_drv : Define the phy clocks driver strength in ohm
  when connect LPDDR2.

- phy_lpddr2_cmd_drv : Define the phy commands driver strength in ohm
  when connect LPDDR2.

- phy_lpddr2_dqs_drv : Define the phy dqs and dq driver strength in ohm
  when connect LPDDR2.
