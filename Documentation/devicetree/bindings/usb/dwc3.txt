synopsys DWC3 CORE

DWC3- USB3 CONTROLLER

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "snps,dwc3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Interrupts used by the dwc3 controller.

Optional properties:
 - usb-phy : array of phandle for the PHY device.  The first element
   in the array is expected to be a handle to the USB2/HS PHY and
   the second element is expected to be a handle to the USB3/SS PHY
 - phys: from the *Generic PHY* bindings
 - phy-names: from the *Generic PHY* bindings
 - tx-fifo-resize: determines if the FIFO *has* to be reallocated.
 - snps,usb3_lpm_capable: determines if platform is USB3 LPM capable
 - snps,u2ss_inp3_quirk: set if we enable P3 OK for U2/SS Inactive quirk
 - snps,dis_enblslpm_quirk: when set clears the enblslpm in GUSB2PHYCFG,
			disabling the suspend signal to the PHY.
 - snps,dis-u3-autosuspend-quirk: when set USB core driver will disable
			USB3 autosuspend function.
 - snps,dis_u3_susphy_quirk: when set core will disable USB3 suspend phy.
 - snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk: when set core will disable USB2 suspend phy.
 - snps,dis-u2-freeclk-exists-quirk: when set, clear the u2_freeclk_exists
			in GUSB2PHYCFG, specify that USB2 PHY doesn't provide
			a free-running PHY clock.
 - snps,del_phy_power_chg_quirk: when set core will delay PHY power change
			from P0 to P1/P2/P3.
 - snps,dis-del-phy-power-chg-quirk: when set core will change PHY power
			from P0 to P1/P2/P3 without delay.
 - snps,tx-ipgap-linecheck-dis-quirk: when set, disable u2mac linestate check
			during HS transmit.

This is usually a subnode to DWC3 glue to which it is connected.
