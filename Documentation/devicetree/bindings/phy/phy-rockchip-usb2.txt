ROCKCHIP USB2.0 PHY WITH INNO IP BLOCK

Required properties (phy grf node):
 - compatible : should be the listed compatibles:
	* "rockchip,rk322xh-usb2phy-grf"
	* "rockchip,usb2phy-grf"
	* "syscon"
	* "simple-mfd";
- reg : the base address of grf for usb-phy configuration.

Required properties (phy (parent) node):
- compatible : should be the listed compatibles:
	* "rockchip,rk322xh-usb-phy"
	* "rockchip,rk322x-usb-phy"
- #address-cells : should be 1
- #size-cells : should be 0

Required properties (port (child) node):
- #phy-cells : must be 0. See ./phy-bindings.txt for details.
- reg : the address offset of grf for usb-phy configuration.
- interrupts : specify an interrupt for each entry in interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names : a list which shall be the following entries:
	* "linestate" : for the host linestate interrupt.
Example:

usb2phy_grf: syscon@ff450000 {
	compatible = "rockchip,rk322xh-usb2phy-grf",
		     "rockchip,usb2phy-grf", "syscon", "simple-mfd";
	reg = <0x0 0xff450000 0x0 0x1000>;

	u2phy: usb2-phy@104 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk322xh-usb-phy",
			     "rockchip,rk322x-usb-phy";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		status = "disabled";

		u2phy_host: host-port {
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0x104>;
			interrupts =<GIC_SPI 62 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH> ;
			interrupt-names = "linestate";
		};
	};
};
